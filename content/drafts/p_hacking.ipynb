    "The main point of this article will be gaining a greater understanding of what p-values are and why they are (and are not) evil. I specifically want to address the idea that using a p-value < 0.05 was never meant as a way to say something in particular about a specific experiment. According to Neyman and Pearson (see Statistics Done Wrong), the goal was to come up with a process that would guarantee that false positives are kept at, or below a certain threshold. What this means for us is that the normal process of science (using a p < 0.05 for signifigance testing) means that we are fine with a 5% false positive rate, i.e., we are fine with 5% of scientific findings appearing to be true even when they are not."
