I am a software engineer and data enthusiast. I've worked on everything from the web and mobile to missile defense. I have degrees in Finance and Economics and a Master's in Computer Science, and I've done research in the fields of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Bio-inspired Computing. In my current role, I lead a team of engineers responsible for the development of the software that LinkedIn uses for the hiring of its engineering talent. I'm also the "go to" person on the team for any data analysis, which is my true passion, as you'll likely notice if you spend any amount of time on this website.

    - I am the team lead for the group responsible for the creation of the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for LinkedIn Engineering. My team operates like a startup inside of LinkedIn. We use Agile methods and a tech stack geared towards a fast moving, interactive development cycle. On this team I serve many roles such as that of the technical lead responsible for ensuring the quality and future vision of our software. I also act as a mentor to many of the more junior members of the team. I am also the Python expert for the team where I am always available to answer questions about our tech stack or help out with the design of a feature. Finally, as part of my duties as the tech lead, I've tried to push us towards a more test driven development strategy. To facilitate this approach to development, I created the open source test library Flask-Fixtures (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Fixtures).
