Summary: A review of the highly lauded Harvard Introduction to Data Science course from the perspective of a practicing software engineer.


The course assumes a fairly low-level of experience in either statistics or software engineering. Given my background, I found the lectures/labs of the first full two weeks (i.e., weeks 2 and 3) to be a bit too basic. Depending on your past experience, you may be able to either skip these completely, or watch them on 1.5x or 2x speed just to make sure there aren't any tiny little nuggets of info that you currently lack. In the next two sections, I give a quick overview of the lectures and labs in weeks 2 and 3 with a focus placed on what can be skipped by experienced software engineers.

## Week 2

The first lab and lecture (lecture 2) cover pandas, python, and github. As a software engineer, I have enough experience with github and python, that a majority of the lecture was not terribly useful to me. That said, though I have a bit of experience with pandas, I don't find it terribly intuitive (comically, I find R and dplyr more intuitive here), so I did find this portion of the lecture to be a nice review/practice. I still ended up watching the lecture at 1.5x speed, so most experienced engineers will be able to do the same, and given your level of experience in pandas, you may be able to skip these videos completely. I would however, suggest watching lecture 3 since it goes into some detail on good data visualization, which even though I knew most of what was covered, I still found it to be a very useful and entertaining review.

## Week 3

Assuming that you have at least a small amount of experience with SQL, relational databases, and pandas, you can probably skip the majority of Lecture 4. The lecture does show how to do many of the typical tasks of querying, aggregating, and modifying a dataset both in SQL and pandas, so if you are rusty in either one of those areas, it may be worth watching the lecture in 2x time for a quick review. For the most part though, for anyone with a background in software engineering and at least a passing familiarity with pandas, the real meat of the class does not begin until Lecture 5 at the end of week 3.
